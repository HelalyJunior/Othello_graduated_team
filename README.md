# Othello Game
This repository contains a classic implementation of the Othello game. Othello, also known as Reversi, is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. 
The objective of the game is to have the majority of your colored discs on the board at the end of the game.

* Run the game  by pressing OthelloProject.exe
* To start a game simply choose on of the modes in the home screen.
* For the modes that include AI , you will need to select the difficulty level using the sliding button where the default is level-1 and as you slide it to the right you will make it harder.
## Features
* Player versus Player: Enjoy playing against a friend on the same device. Take turns placing your discs strategically to conquer the board.
* Player versus AI: Test your skills against an AI opponent. Choose from four different difficulty levels to match your experience and challenge yourself.
* Interactive GUI: The game provides an intuitive graphical user interface that makes it easy to play and navigate through the game.
## How to Play?
* The game starts with two black and two white discs placed in the center of the board.
* Players take turns placing their discs on empty squares, with their color facing up.
* A move must be made by placing a disc adjacent to an opponent's disc in such a way that it surrounds one or more of the opponent's discs.
* All the opponent's discs that are surrounded in any straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) by the newly placed disc are flipped to the current player's color.
* If a player cannot make a valid move, their turn is forfeited.
* The game continues until there are no valid moves left for one of the two players or the board is full.
* The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end wins the game.
